<p>Artorias is a bare-metal x86 boot system that starts from the master boot record (MBR), loads a second-stage bootloader, transitions to 32-bit protected mode, and executes a C kernel with minimal EHCI (USB 2.0) controller support.</p>

## Features
- Custom x86 bootloader (MBR-based)
- Freestanding 32-bit kernel
- VGA text output, serial port (COM1), and programmable interval timer (PIT) drivers
- PCI bus enumeration
- Minimal EHCI (USB 2.0) controller support
  - Detects EHCI controllers via PCI class/subclass/progIF
  - Maps MMIO registers and parses EHCI capability and operational registers
  - Properly halts, resets, and starts the controller
  - Powers USB ports and detects connected high-speed devices
  - Performs basic port resets and reports connection status

## Requirements
- GCC Cross-Compiler (i686-elf-gcc)
- GNU Make
- NASM 
- QEMU

## Building
```bash
make all    # Build boot sector and disk image
make run    # Run in QEMU
make clean  # Clean build artifacts
```
> The ```make run``` command attaches a virtual USB EHCI controller to QEMU to test the driver logic.

## Limitations
- This project implements an EHCI (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) driver, which only handles USB 2.0 high-speed (480 Mbps) devices.
Low-speed (1.5 Mbps) and full-speed (12 Mbps) devices require companion controllers (UHCI/OHCI) and port handoff logic, which are not implemented. USB 3.x (xHCI) devices are also unsupported.
- The driver does not issue additional control transfers to retrieve string descriptors (such as manufacturer name, product name, or serial number). As a result, devices cannot be identified by human-readable names and are only detected at a structural level.
- The driver cannot guarantee reliable control transfer completion due to limitations in hardware testing and QEMU EHCI emulation, meaning device enumeration beyond basic detection is incomplete.
